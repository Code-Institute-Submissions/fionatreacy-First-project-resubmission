            <p>
                Originally classified as especially grand passage tomb, Newgrange has since been recognised by
                archaologist
                to be a large temple used by Bronze age Irish people as a place of worship in the Neolithic era.
                Estimated
                to have taken 30 years and 200,000 tonnes of stone, it was central to the farming community who built it
                5,200 years ago. Megalithic art can be seen all around Newgrange, large stones adorned with swirls are a
                common sight. The exact purpose of this art isn't known, opinions vary between it being decorative or
                being
                symbolic and religiously significant.

            <br>
            <p>
                As well as being considered a place of worship, Newgrange was used as a tomb for the dead. Newgrange is
                considered to be a large passage tomb, theoretically the people of the time believed that burying their
                dead
                in this tomb would send them to the afterlife. Upon excavation,
                the cremated remains of several indivuduals and families were discovered. Many goods were left with the
                remains including marbles, pendants and beads. Originally there were probably many more people buried
                here,
                and many more gifts sent with them to the afterlife. Due to grave robbers and general degredation
                over
                time
                most of this has been lost to history.
