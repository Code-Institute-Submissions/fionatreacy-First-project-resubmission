            <h2>Ancient Astronomy</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Evidence of ancient astronomy can be seen at Newgrange during the solstices, on the shortest and longest
                days of the
                year. At sunrise for approximately 15 minutes, a beam of light illuminates the chamber of Newgrange.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This event isn't coincidental, it was built with this event in mind. The
                sunlight enters through a specially engineered opening in the roof, known as a roof box. This feat was
                achieved by groups of people in the local community with significant knowledge of astronomy, engineering
                and building.

            <h2>Religious Significance</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                It's theorised that the people who built Newgrange had an astronimically-based religion. Ths would
                explain why they would go through the time and effort of ensuring that Newgrange was built in line with
                the sun during the solstices.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This theory would also assist in understanding the significance of the megalithic art found around the
                site. Carvings that seem to represent astral imagery such as the Belt of Orion, and spirals that could
                be depicting formations of
                stars are a common sight.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
